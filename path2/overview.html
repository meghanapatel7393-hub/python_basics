    <h1>PATH 2 Overview (Django / Flask / FastAPI)</h1>
    <pre>
| Framework   | Where Used in PATH 2                                      | Purpose / Usage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Flask**   | Majority of PATH 2 lessons (Lessons 1–32)                 | Focused on **building REST APIs** from scratch, covering: routing, CRUD, authentication, rate limiting, caching, logging, testing, deployment, security, scaling, and load balancing. Flask is lightweight and perfect for hands-on API development.                                                                                                   |
| **Django**  | Introduced in the roadmap/overview at the start of PATH 2 | Mentioned for comparison and context; Django is a **full-featured web framework**, typically used for **large-scale web apps** with built-in ORM, admin panel, and templating. In PATH 2, you mostly focus on Flask REST APIs rather than full Django projects.                                                                                        |
| **FastAPI** | Also mentioned at the start                               | FastAPI is a **modern, high-performance Python API framework** for async APIs. It is noted in PATH 2 as an **alternative to Flask** for creating REST APIs, especially if you want **fast async endpoints and automatic OpenAPI documentation**. PATH 2 focuses on Flask first, and FastAPI is highlighted for advanced or high-performance use cases. |



In PATH 2, you did not actually cover Django in a hands-on way.

Django was mentioned briefly at the start for context, to show that it’s another popular Python web framework.

The actual lessons (1–32) focus entirely on Flask for building REST APIs.

FastAPI was also mentioned as an alternative for modern, high-performance APIs, but you didn’t do hands-on projects with it either.

So, all the coding, examples, testing, deployment, and scaling you did in PATH 2 were with Flask.
